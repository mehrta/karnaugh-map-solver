# Karnaugh Map Solver
A visual and easy to use Karnaugh Map Solver application  (C#, Windows Forms)


I wrote this application as a practical project for "Digital Systems" course when I was studying at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (Year 2007).
The application was created by .Net Framework 2 (I updated the version of .Net framework to 4.7 so you can easily run it).
